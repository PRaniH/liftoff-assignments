### Overview
3LTB
Last Live Leg Trade Board for Flight Attendants

The name of the project is Last Live Leg Trade Board or 3LTB, for short. The idea originated with a group member who is a flight attendant. In his company, flight attendants are currently capable of trading work assignments in their entirety, but the application in place does not accommodate the trading of separate legs of a trip among the employees. This application will provide the ability to do just that.

More:
The 3LTB app. will facilitate the dropping, picking up, and trading of flight legs between flight attendants (FAs).
Currently, FAs are assigned work schedules composed of different flight legs (city to city segments) they are assigned to work.  FAs are allowed to change their assigned flight legs through direct FA-to-FA swaps. There are numerous legal, airline, and union rules impacting this process, for example: total work shift hours allowed, skill requirements like speaking certain languages on certain legs, and financial incentives that FAs can offer each other along with the flight leg.
The FA Trader app. will have functionality where FAs can log in to their own accounts in order to post flight leg assignments they wish to drop, bid on flight leg assignments they wish to pick up, and trade flight leg assignments.

### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
Posting: An authenticated user will be able to post flight legs he wishes to drop.
Bidding: An authenticated user can pick up other flight attendant's assignment that is of interest to him.
Trading: An authenticated user can trade flight assignments with other employees.
